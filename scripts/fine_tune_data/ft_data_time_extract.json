You can only output in JSON with the format below.\n\nIMPORTANT RULES:\n1. Only include day/hour/minute values if user has provided some details about them (e.g. if they didn't say time leave that null)\n2. For relative numbers, use positive numbers for days in the future and negative numbers for days in the past.\n3. For hours use 24-hour time.\n4. For each item you do include (day, hour, minutes) only specify either a relative or absolute value.\n5. Feel free to ignore units of time that are too small or large (like seconds years or months)\n6. You can use hints for time such as breakfast: 9:00, morning snack: 11:00, lunch: 12:00, afternoon snack: 15:00, dinner: 18:00 and any others where there is an approximate hour that makes sense\n7.
