If the entries don't overlap well we can instead of to continue searching, This is for a food logging app so we should not match with items that we know have a different nutritional profiles.\n\n\nREAD AND FOLLOW THESE STEPS. \n\n1. If the user provides specific details in user_food_logged (e.g., no sugar added, low-fat, added salt, cooked, vegan, brand etc), we should match them with our database items that also mention those details in some way (e.g. skim milk and fat free milk can be use interchangeably). Do not assume our database items have the details the user requested unless it is explicitly mentioned in the database entry.\n\nSometimes user inputs can have typos so matching with similar sound names fine.\n\n2. In the absence of specific details that Step 1 may have highlighted you may make some common sense assumptions about user's input.\n\nJust assume user_food_logged is the single plain version of something with some common sense assumptions about the preparation or details that the user will have expected and try to match using that. E.g. do not assume that things like \"apple\" and \"apple crumble\" are the same but it is fine to match \"rice\" with \"cooked rice\" or  \"oats\" with \"cooked oats, \"milk\" with \"low fat milk\" or \"full fat milk\" since these are very normal things to assume.\n\n3. When matching with user_food_logged: Unless user_food_logged requires a brand, try matching with other unbranded items. Do not match if important details in user_food_logged aren't in the database entry (e.g. \"salted almonds\" can't match with \"unsalted almonds\" but can match with \"almonds with salt\"). 'continue_food_search' should always be set to true if user_food_logged and best_food_match_id.name don't cover all the requirements set fourth by the user (e.g. don't match \"banana\" with \"fried banana\", or \"strawberry yogurt\" with \"strawberry\" but do match \"peanuts\" with \"salted peanuts\" - user can be more precise next time).\n\n4. If a best_food_match_id is found, also select an alternative_match_id, ensuring it aligns with any details in user_food_logged (e.g. the same brand or lack of). It serves as a second best option. E.g. if user said milk and we matched with low fat milk we could have full fat milk as alternative_match_id.\n\n5. Evaluate if the user would be satisfied with best_food_match_id based on their requirements. E.g. if you matched \"carrot\" with \"carrot juice\" they would be annoyed since while it contains the same concept it is definitely not the same item and we should search more online. If they wanted \"fat free milk\", matching with \"full fat milk\" is a bad match. Set 'continue_food_search' to true if there's any discrepancy that would cause surprise to users. However if they said \"mixed nuts\" and you matched with \"salted mixed buts\" that's fine.\n\n6. Output the final assessment in a valid JSON format:\n{\n  \"continue_food_search\": \"boolean\",\n  \"best_food_match_id\": \"number | null\",\n  \"alternative_match_id\": \"number | null\"\n}\n\n\ncontinue_food_search - is true if we think there will be a better match if we continue searching in third party databases as well as online. Set this to true if we cannot obviously fulfill all the requirements specified in user_food_logged\n\nbest_food_match_id - is null if there is no good food match otherwise it is a single integer referring to one of the items above. \n\nalternative_match_id - contains the id of a second potential match the user may have wanted that is different from best_food_match_id (e.g. if best_food_match_id is 'unsalted butter' then alternative_match_id can't be 'butter no salt' but could be say 'salted butter')\n\n\nOUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Reasoning should follow these steps:\nThink what the user_food_logged means based on common sense. Then explicitly compare it to best_food_match_id.name. Decide if continue_food_search should be set to true based on any discrepancy between user input and matched item. \n\n2. Output best_food_match_id (the full name including any brand) and user_food_logged. Then promise before outputting the JSON no critically bad matches like 'carrot' with 'carrot juice' will be made.\n\n3.

If the user provides specific details in user_food_logged (e.g., no sugar added, low-fat, added salt, cooked, vegan, brand etc) that they are matched accurately with our database items. Do not assume our database items have the details the user request unless it is explicitly mentioned in the database entry or it is a very common assumption (e.g. cannot assume milk has added vitamin D unless the entry says so.).\n\nIt is  mistake to match with items that don't have details users request including a different brand (though be aware user inputs may have typos or bad pronunciation so matching with similar sound brands is fine).\n\n2. If user_food_logged is vague you should make the most reasonable assumptions about the preparation or details (e.g., 'rice' usually implies 'cooked rice', or that 'oats' will usually mean 'cooked oats, \"milk\" could be \"low fat milk\" or \"full fat milk\") that the user may have expected and try to match using that. Obviously if user has been specific about a detail keep use that to match. Do not assume that things like \"apple\" and \"apple crumble\" are the same though since they are vastly different.\n\n3. Follow these rules for matching with user_food_logged: Prefer unbranded items unless specifics are mentioned; refuse matches if details from user_food_logged aren't in the database; and don't assume unmentioned details about database items. Set 'continue_food_search' to true if a good nutritional match isn't found. (e.g. don't match banana with fried banana, or strawberry yogurt with strawberry)\n\n4. If a good match is found, also select an alternative_match_id, ensuring it aligns with any details in user_food_logged (e.g. the same brand or lack of). It serves as a second best option. E.g. if user said milk and we matched with low fat milk we could have full fat milk as alternative_match_id.\n\n5. Confirm the best match with user_food_logged includes all user-specified details. If not, set 'continue_food_search' to true.\n\n6. Evaluate if the user would be satisfied with the match based on their detailed requirements. E.g. if you matched \"carrot\" with \"carrot juice\" they would be annoyed since while it contains the same concept it is definitely not the same item. Set 'continue_food_search' to true if there's any discrepancy. However if they said \"milk\" and you failed to match with \"full fat milk\" they would also be confused.\n\n7.

If the user provides specific details in user_food_logged (e.g., no sugar added, low-fat, added salt, cooked, vegan, brand etc), we should match them with our database items that also mention those details in some way (e.g. skim milk and fat free milk can be use interchangeably). Do not assume our database items have the details the user requested unless it is explicitly mentioned in the database entry.\n\nSometimes user inputs can have typos so matching with similar sound names fine.\n\n2. In the absence of specific details that Step 1 may have highlighted you may make some common sense assumptions about user's input.\n\nJust assume user_food_logged is the single plain version of something with some common sense assumptions about the preparation or details that the user will have expected and try to match using that. E.g. do not assume that things like \"apple\" and \"apple crumble\" are the same but it is fine to match \"rice\" with \"cooked rice\" or  \"oats\" with \"cooked oats, \"milk\" with \"low fat milk\" or \"full fat milk\" since these are very normal things to assume.\n\n3. When matching with user_food_logged: Unless user_food_logged requires a brand, try matching with other unbranded items. Do not match if important details in user_food_logged aren't in the database entry (e.g. \"salted almonds\" can't match with \"unsalted almonds\" but can match with \"almonds with salt\"). 'continue_food_search' should always be set to true if user_food_logged and best_food_match_id.name don't cover all the requirements set fourth by the user (e.g. don't match \"banana\" with \"fried banana\", or \"strawberry yogurt\" with \"strawberry\" but do match \"peanuts\" with \"salted peanuts\" - user can be more precise next time).\n\n4. If a best_food_match_id is found, also select an alternative_match_id, ensuring it aligns with any details in user_food_logged (e.g. the same brand or lack of). It serves as a second best option. E.g. if user said milk and we matched with low fat milk we could have full fat milk as alternative_match_id.\n\n5. Evaluate if the user would be satisfied with best_food_match_id based on their requirements. E.g. if you matched \"carrot\" with \"carrot juice\" they would be annoyed since while it contains the same concept it is definitely not the same item and we should search more online. If they wanted \"fat free milk\", matching with \"full fat milk\" is a bad match. Set 'continue_food_search' to true if there's any discrepancy that would cause surprise to users. However if they said \"mixed nuts\" and you matched with \"salted mixed buts\" that's fine.\n\n6. Output the final assessment in a valid JSON format:\n{\n  \"continue_food_search\": \"boolean\",\n  \"best_food_match_id\": \"number | null\",\n  \"alternative_match_id\": \"number | null\"\n}\n\n\ncontinue_food_search - is true if we think there will be a better match if we continue searching in third party databases as well as online. Set this to true if we cannot obviously fulfill all the requirements specified in user_food_logged\n\nbest_food_match_id - is null if there is no good food match otherwise it is a single integer referring to one of the items above. \n\nalternative_match_id - contains the id of a second potential match the user may have wanted that is different from best_food_match_id (e.g. if best_food_match_id is 'unsalted butter' then alternative_match_id can't be 'butter no salt' but could be say 'salted butter')\n\n\nOUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1.
