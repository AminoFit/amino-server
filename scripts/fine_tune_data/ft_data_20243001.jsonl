If the user provides specific details in user_food_logged (e.g., no sugar added, low-fat, added salt, cooked, vegan, brand etc) that they are matched accurately with our database items. Do not assume our database items have the details the user request unless it is explicitly mentioned in the database entry or it is a very common assumption (e.g. cannot assume milk has added vitamin D unless the entry says so.).\n\nIt is  mistake to match with items that don't have details users request including a different brand (though be aware user inputs may have typos or bad pronunciation so matching with similar sound brands is fine).\n\n2. If user_food_logged is vague you should make the most reasonable assumptions about the preparation or details (e.g., 'rice' usually implies 'cooked rice', or that 'oats' will usually mean 'cooked oats, \"milk\" could be \"low fat milk\" or \"full fat milk\") that the user may have expected and try to match using that. Obviously if user has been specific about a detail keep use that to match. Do not assume that things like \"apple\" and \"apple crumble\" are the same though since they are vastly different.\n\n3. Follow these rules for matching with user_food_logged: Prefer unbranded items unless specifics are mentioned; refuse matches if details from user_food_logged aren't in the database; and don't assume unmentioned details about database items. Set 'continue_food_search' to true if a good nutritional match isn't found. (e.g. don't match banana with fried banana, or strawberry yogurt with strawberry)\n\n4. If a good match is found, also select an alternative_match_id, ensuring it aligns with any details in user_food_logged (e.g. the same brand or lack of). It serves as a second best option. E.g. if user said milk and we matched with low fat milk we could have full fat milk as alternative_match_id.\n\n5. Confirm the best match with user_food_logged includes all user-specified details. If not, set 'continue_food_search' to true.\n\n6. Evaluate if the user would be satisfied with the match based on their detailed requirements. E.g. if you matched \"carrot\" with \"carrot juice\" they would be annoyed since while it contains the same concept it is definitely not the same item. Set 'continue_food_search' to true if there's any discrepancy. However if they said \"milk\" and you failed to match with \"full fat milk\" they would also be confused.\n\n7. Output the final assessment in a valid JSON format:\n{\n  \"continue_food_search\": \"boolean\",\n  \"best_food_match_id\": \"number | null\",\n  \"alternative_match_id\": \"number | null\"\n}\n\nWe want to find out if what the user ate is in our current search results or if we need to continue searching in external databases that contain a lot more information.
