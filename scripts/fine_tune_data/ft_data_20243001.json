For example \"bread with brie\" cannot match \"bread\" alone since we'd be missing a whole chunk of nutritional info.\n\n4.

Reasoning should follow these steps:\nThink what the user_food_logged means based on common sense. Then explicitly compare it options in database_search_results to select a best_food_match_id if there is a an accurate and price match.\n\n2.

If the user provides specific details in user_food_logged (e.g., no sugar added, low-fat, added salt, cooked, vegan, brand etc), we should match them with our database items that also mention those details in some way (e.g. skim milk and fat free milk can be use interchangeably). Do not assume database_search_results have the details the user requested unless it is explicitly mentioned in the database entry. Do not match if important details in user_food_logged aren't in the database entry (e.g. \"salted almonds\" can't match with \"unsalted almonds\" but can match with \"almonds with salt\").\n\n2. Sometimes user inputs can have typos so matching with similar sound names fine.\n\n3. In the absence of specific details that Step 1 may have highlighted you may make some common sense assumptions about user's input.\n\nJust assume user_food_logged is the single plain version of something with some common sense assumptions about the preparation or details that the user will have expected and try to match using that. Never match user_food_logged with items in the search results that have overlapping words but are clearly different. E.g. if user says \"apple\" do not match with \"apple crumble\". You can and must match \"rice\" with \"cooked rice\" or  \"oats\" with \"cooked oats, \"milk\" with \"low fat milk\" or \"full fat milk\" since these are very normal things to assume.\n\n4. On the flipside of rule 4, if user_food_logged mentions a specific preperation, detail or brand match with that. \"chocolate by lindt\" can match with \"dark chocolate by lindt\".\n\n5. If a best_food_match_id is found, also select an alternative_match_id, ensuring it aligns with any details in user_food_logged. It serves as a second best option. E.g. if user said milk and we matched with low fat milk we could have full fat milk as alternative_match_id.\n\n6. Evaluate if the user would be satisfied with best_food_match_id based on their requirements. E.g. if you matched \"carrot\" with \"carrot juice\" they would be annoyed since while it contains the same concept it is definitely not the same item and we should search more online. If they wanted \"fat free milk\", matching with \"full fat milk\" is a bad match. Set 'no_good_matches' to true if there's any discrepancy that would cause surprise to users. However if they said \"mixed nuts\" and you matched with \"salted mixed buts\" that's fine.\n\n7. Output the final assessment in a valid JSON format:\n{\n  \"no_good_matches\": \"boolean\",\n  \"best_food_match_id\": \"number | null\",\n  \"alternative_match_id\": \"number | null\"\n}\n\n\nno_good_matches(bool) - is true if we think there will be a better match if we continue searching online.

E.g. if user said milk and we matched with low fat milk we could have full fat milk as alternative_match_id.\n\n6.

If the user provides specific details in user_food_logged (e.g., no sugar added, low-fat, added salt, cooked, vegan, brand etc), we should match them with our database items that also mention those details in some way (e.g. skim milk and fat free milk can be use interchangeably). Do not assume database_search_results have the details the user requested unless it is explicitly mentioned in the database entry. Do not match if important details in user_food_logged aren't in the database entry (e.g. \"salted almonds\" can't match with \"unsalted almonds\" but can match with \"almonds with salt\").\n\n2. Sometimes user inputs can have typos so matching with similar sound names fine.\n\n3. In the absence of specific details that Step 1 may have highlighted you may make some common sense assumptions about user's input.\n\nJust assume user_food_logged is the single plain version of something with some common sense assumptions about the preparation or details that the user will have expected and try to match using that. Never match user_food_logged with items in the search results that have overlapping words but are clearly different. E.g. if user says \"apple\" do not match with \"apple crumble\". You can and must match \"rice\" with \"cooked rice\" or  \"oats\" with \"cooked oats, \"milk\" with \"low fat milk\" or \"full fat milk\" since these are very normal things to assume.\n\n4. On the flipside of rule 4, if user_food_logged mentions a specific preperation, detail or brand match with that. \"chocolate by lindt\" can match with \"dark chocolate by lindt\".\n\n5. If a best_food_match_id is found, also select an alternative_match_id, ensuring it aligns with any details in user_food_logged. It serves as a second best option. E.g. if user said milk and we matched with low fat milk we could have full fat milk as alternative_match_id.\n\n6.

E.g. if you matched \"carrot\" with \"carrot juice\" they would be annoyed since while it contains the same concept it is definitely not the same item and we should search more online. If they wanted \"fat free milk\", matching with \"full fat milk\" is a bad match. Set 'no_good_matches' to true if there's any discrepancy that would cause surprise to users. However if they said \"mixed nuts\" and you matched with \"salted mixed buts\" that's fine.\n\n7.

If the user provides specific details in user_food_logged (e.g., no sugar added, low-fat, added salt, cooked, vegan, brand etc), we should match them with our database items that also mention those details in some way (e.g. skim milk and fat free milk can be use interchangeably). Do not assume database_search_results have the details the user requested unless it is explicitly mentioned in the database entry. Do not match if important details in user_food_logged aren't in the database entry (e.g. \"salted almonds\" can't match with \"unsalted almonds\" but can match with \"almonds with salt\").\n\n2. Sometimes user inputs can have typos so matching with similar sound names fine.\n\n3. In the absence of specific details that Step 1 may have highlighted you may make some common sense assumptions about user's input.\n\nJust assume user_food_logged is the single plain version of something with some common sense assumptions about the preparation or details that the user will have expected and try to match using that. Never match user_food_logged with items in the search results that have overlapping words but are clearly different. E.g. if user says \"apple\" do not match with \"apple crumble\". You can and must match \"rice\" with \"cooked rice\" or  \"oats\" with \"cooked oats, \"milk\" with \"low fat milk\" or \"full fat milk\" since these are very normal things to assume.\n\n4. On the flipside of rule 4, if user_food_logged mentions a specific preperation, detail or brand match with that. \"chocolate by lindt\" can match with \"dark chocolate by lindt\".\n\n5. If a best_food_match_id is found, also select an alternative_match_id, ensuring it aligns with any details in user_food_logged. It serves as a second best option. E.g. if user said milk and we matched with low fat milk we could have full fat milk as alternative_match_id.\n\n6. Evaluate if the user would be satisfied with best_food_match_id based on their requirements. E.g. if you matched \"carrot\" with \"carrot juice\" they would be annoyed since while it contains the same concept it is definitely not the same item and we should search more online. If they wanted \"fat free milk\", matching with \"full fat milk\" is a bad match. Set 'no_good_matches' to true if there's any discrepancy that would cause surprise to users. However if they said \"mixed nuts\" and you matched with \"salted mixed buts\" that's fine.\n\n7. Output the final assessment in a valid JSON format:\n{\n  \"no_good_matches\": \"boolean\",\n  \"best_food_match_id\": \"number | null\",\n  \"alternative_match_id\": \"number | null\"\n}\n\n\nno_good_matches - is true if we think there will be a better match if we continue searching online.

If the user provides specific details in user_food_logged (e.g., no sugar added, low-fat, added salt, cooked, vegan, brand etc), we should match them with our database items that also mention those details in some way (e.g. skim milk and fat free milk can be use interchangeably).

Do not match if important details in user_food_logged aren't in the database entry (e.g. \"salted almonds\" can't match with \"unsalted almonds\" but can match with \"almonds with salt\").\n\n2.

Never match user_food_logged with items in the search results that have overlapping words but are clearly different. E.g. if user says \"apple\" do not match with \"apple crumble\".

On the flipside of rule 4, if user_food_logged mentions a specific preperation, detail or brand match with that. \"chocolate by lindt\" can match with \"dark chocolate by lindt\".\n\n5.

If the user provides specific details in user_food_logged (e.g., no sugar added, low-fat, added salt, cooked, vegan, brand etc), we should match them with our database items that also mention those details in some way (e.g. skim milk and fat free milk can be use interchangeably). Do not assume database_search_results have the details the user requested unless it is explicitly mentioned in the database entry. Do not match if important details in user_food_logged aren't in the database entry (e.g. \"salted almonds\" can't match with \"unsalted almonds\" but can match with \"almonds with salt\").\n\n2. Sometimes user inputs can have typos so matching with similar sound names fine.\n\n3. In the absence of specific details that Step 1 may have highlighted you may make some common sense assumptions about user's input.\n\nJust assume user_food_logged is the single plain version of something with some common sense assumptions about the preparation or details that the user will have expected and try to match using that. Never match user_food_logged with items in the search results that have overlapping words but are clearly different. E.g. if user says \"apple\" do not match with \"apple crumble\". You can and must match \"rice\" with \"cooked rice\" or  \"oats\" with \"cooked oats, \"milk\" with \"low fat milk\" or \"full fat milk\" since these are very normal things to assume.\n\n4. On the flipside of rule 4, if user_food_logged mentions a specific preperation, detail or brand match with that. \"chocolate by lindt\" can match with \"dark chocolate by lindt\".\n\n5. If a best_food_match_id is found, also select an alternative_match_id, ensuring it aligns with any details in user_food_logged. It serves as a second best option. E.g. if user said milk and we matched with low fat milk we could have full fat milk as alternative_match_id.\n\n6. Evaluate if the user would be satisfied with best_food_match_id based on their requirements. E.g. if you matched \"carrot\" with \"carrot juice\" they would be annoyed since while it contains the same concept it is definitely not the same item and we should search more online. If they wanted \"fat free milk\", matching with \"full fat milk\" is a bad match. Set 'no_good_matches' to true if there's any discrepancy that would cause surprise to users. However if they said \"mixed nuts\" and you matched with \"salted mixed buts\" that's fine.\n\n7.

When matching with user_food_logged: Unless user_food_logged requires a brand, try matching with other unbranded items. Do not match if important details in user_food_logged aren't in the database entry (e.g. \"salted almonds\" can't match with \"unsalted almonds\" but can match with \"almonds with salt\"). If we think there is a good candidate set best_food_match_id to the item id. However set 'continue_food_search' to true if user_food_logged and best_food_match_id.name don't cover all the requirements set fourth by the user (e.g. don't match \"banana\" with \"fried banana\", or \"strawberry yogurt\" with \"strawberry\" but do match \"peanuts\" with \"salted peanuts\" - user can be more precise next time).\n\n4. If the best_food_match_id.name matches with user_food_logged AND includes all user-required details we've done well (e.g. if user_food_logged called out specific details like preparation, additives or certain brands we should be sure best_food_match_id.name also contains them)! If we think we're missing important details, set 'continue_food_search' to true.\n\n5. If a best_food_match_id is found, also select an alternative_match_id, ensuring it aligns with any details in user_food_logged (e.g. the same brand or lack of). It serves as a second best option. E.g. if user said milk and we matched with low fat milk we could have full fat milk as alternative_match_id.\n\n6. Evaluate if the user would be satisfied with best_food_match_id based on their requirements. E.g. if you matched \"carrot\" with \"carrot juice\" they would be annoyed since while it contains the same concept it is definitely not the same item. If they wanted \"fat free milk\", \"full fat milk\" is a bad match. Set 'continue_food_search' to true if there's any discrepancy that would cause surprise. However if they said \"mixed nuts\" and you matched with \"salted mixed buts\" they would likey be fine with that since they didn't specify if unsalted or not.\n\n7. Output the final assessment in a valid JSON format:\n{\n  \"continue_food_search\": \"boolean\",\n  \"best_food_match_id\": \"number | null\",\n  \"alternative_match_id\": \"number | null\"\n}\n\n\ncontinue_food_search - is true if we think there will be a better match if we continue searching in third party databases as well as online. Set this to true if we cannot obviously fulfill all the requirements specified in user_food_logged\n\nbest_food_match_id - is null if there is no good food match otherwise it is a single integer referring to one of the items above. \n\nalternative_match_id - contains the id of a second potential match the user may have wanted that is different from best_food_match_id (e.g. if best_food_match_id is 'unsalted butter' then alternative_match_id can't be 'butter no salt' but could be say 'salted butter')\n\n\nKeep you reasoning short but first reason (2-3 sentences) then output a valid JSON.\n\nBe sure to check if the item you want to suggest as best_food_match_id is actually the same food-wise and not just similar in name but actually very different (dairy cannot match with milk, banana cannot match with banana ice cream etc).\n\nAlso when users are explicit about brands it is best continue searching since they may have nutritional or micro-nutritional differences (eg some milk brands are ultra-filtered or have added vitamin D). \n\nIf user_food_logged is something like \"steak with fries\" we must not match with just \"steak\" as we ignore the fries that contribute a lot to the nutritional profile since it is two different items of food. We must instead continue search in the absence of a \"steak with fries\" option.\n\nFinish with a valid JSON."

Set this to true if we cannot obviously fulfill all the requirements specified in user_food_logged\n\nbest_food_match_id - is null if there is no good food match otherwise it is a single integer referring to one of the items above. \n\nalternative_match_id - contains the id of a second potential match the user may have wanted that is different from best_food_match_id (e.g. if best_food_match_id is 'unsalted butter' then alternative_match_id can't be 'butter no salt' but could be say 'salted butter')\n\n\nOUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Reasoning should follow these steps:\nThink what the user_food_logged means based on common sense. Then explicitly compare it to best_food_match_id.name. Decide if continue_food_search should be set to true based on any discrepancy between user input and matched item. \n\n2. Output best_food_match_id (the full name including any brand) and user_food_logged. Then promise before outputting the JSON no critically bad matches like 'carrot' with 'carrot juice' will be made.\n\n3. Finish with a valid JSON."
